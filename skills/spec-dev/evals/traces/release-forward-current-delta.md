Assessment result: `findings`
Implementation readiness: blocked pending a product decision.

The current order specification makes cancellation terminal:

- Cancellation moves an eligible unpaid order to `Trade_Status=CLOSED` in the assessed current requirement.
- Operations against `CLOSED` orders must fail without changing the aggregate in that requirement.
- The assessed design likewise rejects subsequent operations for `CLOSED` orders.

### ORDER-CONFLICT-01 — Critical, blocking

- Affected outcome: `ORDER-CANCEL-01`
- Owner: the two active change intents/deltas
- Conflict: one change replaces terminal cancellation with a reopening transition, while the other requires cancellation to remain terminal.
- Impact: the deltas cannot be composed into one desired state. Their state transitions, API behavior, events, invariants, and tests would be mutually incompatible.
- Resolution condition: an authorized stakeholder must choose whether cancellation is reversible. This is externally observable product behavior and cannot be resolved as an implementation detail.

If reopening is selected, its delta must define at least:

- authorized actors and eligible cancellation reasons;
- reopening time limits and preconditions;
- target trade, payment, fulfillment, and item states;
- inventory reservation or compensation behavior;
- event, audit, idempotency, and failure semantics;
- behavior when fulfillment, refund, or other downstream activity already exists.

If terminal cancellation is selected:

- withdraw or rebase the reopening change;
- retain atomic rejection tests for every post-cancellation mutation;
- clarify what the terminal change adds, because the available current specification already defines cancellation as terminal.

### ORDER-TRACE-02 — Major, readiness-blocking

The workspace does not contain the literal `ORDER-CANCEL-01` identifier or durable active-change artifacts under `docs/spec/changes/`. The mapping to the current cancellation requirement is therefore semantic rather than identifier-backed, and the proposed deltas’ detailed scope, acceptance criteria, and downstream coverage cannot be verified.

Resolve this by having each surviving change explicitly identify the current outcome it replaces and provide observable acceptance criteria. Reassess the affected requirements, design, tasks, and planned evidence after the product decision.

No implementation verification was performed because this was a specification assessment, and no files were modified.
